# Technical Writing Portfolio Artifact 1: `jq` Utility Documentation

## Project Overview
This repository contains the documentation for the `jq` command-line utility, a powerful and indespensible tool for processing JSON data streams.

**Description:** Documents the industry-standard `jq` command-line utility, structured as a developer-focused tutorial and validated command reference for efficiently processing JSON data streams.

The core goal of this project was to demonstrate the ability to analyze a complex developer tool, structure its reference material, and create a hands-on tutorial where every output is validated against real-world sample data.

### Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases the following core technical writing competencies:

| **Skill Focus**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Analytical Rigor          | Applying the precision learned in regulatory writing and scientific research to ensure **100% functional accuracy** in all documented commands and outputs.                            |
| Audience Analysis         | Structuring content for two distinct user needs: a `Getting Started` tutorial (task-based) and a `Command Reference` (lookup/specification-based).                                     |
| Toolchain Proficiency     | Comfortably using the modern technical writer's toolchain, including **Markdown** for content, **Git/GitHub** for version control, and **VS Code** for writing and file management.    |
| Developer Empathy         | Documenting common data challenges (filtering, projection, nested paths) that developers face when working with large log files and data pipelines.                                    |

### Documentation Structure
The documentation is organized into three primary sections:
1. **Overview:** A high-level introduction to `jq` and its relevance in data processing environments.
2. **Getting Started Tutorial:** A four-step, hands-on guide using a sample `.jsonl` log file to demonstrate core filtering and projection functionality.
3. **Command Reference:** a scannable, structured reference table derived from the official help file, detailing the syntax, description, and use case for key filters.

### How to View the Documentation
This documentation is composed of standard Markdown files, designed for readability directly within the GitHub interface (which automatically renders the content) or any standard Markdown editor (like VS Code).

**1. View on GitHub (Recommended)**
The complete documentation set is contained within the `/docs/jq-utility` directory. Click the links below to view the rendered content:
- [Overview](./jq-utility/index.md): High-level summary and usage.
- [Getting Started Tutorial](./jq-utility/getting-started.md): Hands-on tutorial with validated code/output blocks.
- [Command Reference](./jq-utility/reference.md): Structured tables for quick lookup of filters and syntax.

**2. View Locally in VS Code**
You can cline the repository and view the files using the built-in VS Code Markdown Preview.
1. **Clone the Repository:**

```
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/tw-portfolio.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/tw-portfolio.git)
cd tw-portfolio
```

2. **Open in VS Code:** Navigate to the `docs/jq-utility` folder and open any `.md` file. Use the **Open Preview to the Side** command to see the rendered documentation.

## Artifact 2 Status
This repository is designed to host multiple portfolio artifacts. Artifact 2, documentation for the NASA APOD API, is currently in development and will be integrated into the main navigation when complete.
